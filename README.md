Data mining (Classification-Clustering-PCA):
1. Performed exploratory data analysis.
2. Applied different clustering algorithms and compare the results : Kmeans, Hierarchical Clustering (linkage methods such as: single,complete,ward's and average)
3. Applied different classification algorithms and found best classifier: Linear regression, Logistic regression, decision tree, LDA, QDA
4. Performed PCA.
Checked the work by k-cross validation.
